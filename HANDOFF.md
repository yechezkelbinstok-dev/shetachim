# Handoff: Shetachim map

Read this first when picking the project up in a new Claude session or account. It covers
what the owner wants, what exists, what's still open, and the mistakes to avoid.
The latest work is on branch `claude/bold-albattani-aqfnj9`, which the live site is served from.
More detail is in `docs/PLAN.md`.

## The goal (owner's words, summarized)

An interactive custom map of Chabad **shetachim** (the territory under a head shliach),
drawn like a political map where the shetachim *are* the countries. It is not a regular map
with things drawn on top. It starts with the US and Canada, then covers the world.

- Shetachim can be one state, several states or provinces, or parts of states (cut along county
  or town lines, or straight longitude lines). Areas with no shetach entered yet are left blank.
- Toggle between shetach borders and regular (state/country) borders, or show both with one set
  lighter. Which set is lighter is swappable.
- Colorful (political-map colors) or Plain (one color) fills.
- A faint dot for every Chabad center (from the chabad.org locator). Listings at the same address
  are merged into one dot.
- Labels: head shliach full name / last name only / shetach name / off.
- Views: US & Canada, only USA, only Canada. Each view **shows only that area and fills the
  screen**. Later there will be continent views for the world.
- Zoom and pan.
- Cities that have shluchim, on a toggle.
- Each shetach has a **capital** (its flagship center), shown as a star like a national capital.
  **Just the star: never the center's name next to it.** 770 Eastern Parkway (world
  headquarters) gets a bigger star.
- A **Physical** mode: a full, proper map like Google Maps (green land, tan desert, relief,
  water, roads), with every border replaced by shetach borders like the political map.
  (The owner didn't know the word; it was first built as a dark "street map", which was wrong.)

## Owner preferences and mistakes to avoid (important)

The owner got very angry at the first version. The lessons:

1. **Show only shetachim.** No surrounding countries (Mexico, Central America, Caribbean,
   Greenland, Russia) and no areas outside any shetach. Yukon, NWT and Nunavut are hidden
   (`notShown` in `data/shetachim.json`). On the physical map, land outside is faded out.
2. **Don't treat "states" as the default with shetachim as special exceptions.** Every shetach is
   styled the same way. The first version had gray states with one red shetach, and the owner
   hated it.
3. Picking "USA" means *only* the USA is drawn and fills the screen.
4. Don't invent shetach data: head shliach names, territories and capitals come from the owner.
   The current list came from another AI and "could be incorrect, subject to change".
5. **No explanatory text on the page.** The owner hates notes like "Each state is its own shetach
   until…" or "Tap a dot to see them". Controls and data only; keep messages to a few words.
6. The owner is on mobile a lot (and in dark mode). Keep replies short and plain, and don't ask
   many questions. When they say "do everything I asked", do all of it without checking in.
7. The two unlisted centers are public, as the owner said: Riyadh (address unknown, city centre)
   and Istanbul (in Nişantaşı near the American Hospital, a rough spot), in `data/extra-centers.json`.

## Current state (all committed and pushed)

- `web/index.html`: the map, a static page (D3 v7 + TopoJSON from cdnjs; MapLibre GL 4.7.1 from
  cdnjs, loaded only when Physical is picked). It loads `web/data/*`. Features:
  - US & Canada / USA / Canada views; zoom buttons; light and dark themes; phone layout (bottom sheet)
  - Map: **Political** (our own drawing, conic projection, Alaska and Hawaii in corner boxes) or
    **Physical** (OpenFreeMap `liberty` tiles in both themes, with Natural Earth II relief made
    stronger out to state level and greener woods; Web Mercator; Alaska and Hawaii in place).
    On the physical map there are no political fills, the map's own borders and state/country
    names are hidden, our borders (with a white casing) sit over the roads, land outside the
    shown shetachim is faded (a fade under the water layer plus a light one over everything),
    and the map's city names are hidden while our cities are on. The map's colors on the
    physical map are always the light ones. Switching modes keeps the place you were looking at.
  - Borders: Shetachim / States / Both (+ Lighter swap); Colors: Colorful / Plain (political only)
  - Labels: Shetach name (default) / Head shliach / Last name / Off. A shetach that is exactly one
    state falls back to the state's abbreviation where its name doesn't fit.
  - Checkboxes: Chabad centers, Cities with shluchim, Shetach capitals (all on by default)
  - Cities: a ring and a name, biggest first, only where there's room; a zoom-dependent cutoff
    (`CITY_DENSITY`) keeps small towns for when you zoom in. A city right at a capital's star uses
    the star as its marker, with the city's name beside it.
  - Capitals: a star, no label; 770 bigger. Cards on hover/tap for capitals, cities, dots and areas.
  - Blank areas (no shetach): no fill, no label; their card shows the state.
  - If the physical map can't load (no WebGL, or the tiles are blocked, as in a Claude artifact),
    it says so in a few words and stays on Political.
- `scripts/build-data.mjs` (`npm install && npm run build`) builds `web/data/` from:
  - `data/raw/chabad-centers.json`: the chabad.org locator export (4,220 listings) plus
    `data/extra-centers.json`: 4,222 centers → 3,599 dots; 1,967 → 1,763 in the US/CA.
  - `data/shetachim.json`: 57 shetachim with head shluchim and capitals (chabad.org center ids).
    Territory items: state codes, `{state, westOf/eastOf}` longitude cuts, `{counties}` (FIPS),
    `{state, towns}` (Census county subdivisions), `{state, tracts}` (Census tracts). The most
    specific claim wins where they overlap. Unclaimed areas are blank: now Ohio and New York
    outside NYC and Long Island.
  - Drawing: Natural Earth 10m states/provinces. Split states (now PA, WV, NY, MA) are cut in one
    mapshaper `-union` with Census 2022 1:500k counties/towns/tracts (from the Census Bureau's
    GitHub) and longitude rectangles, so the outer edges stay Natural Earth's and every piece
    shares edges with its neighbours. Slivers where Census and Natural Earth disagree are cut
    into 0.03° squares along the outline and each square goes to the nearest piece.
    Output: `web/data/geo.json`, one object `areas` of pieces `{id, state, name, abbr, country, shetach}`.
  - Tagging: NE countries and provinces, Census counties; centers and cities in split states also
    get the piece they're in.
  - Cities: matched to GeoNames (npm `all-the-cities`); 1,001 cities, 81 unmatched (see report).
  - Capitals are checked: the center must exist; a capital outside its shetach is a warning in
    `data/report.md` ("Capitals to check"). All 57 are inside their shetachim now.
- Live site: GitHub Pages from this branch, root folder:
  `https://yechezkelbinstok-dev.github.io/shetachim/` (root `index.html` forwards to `web/`).
- Claude artifact preview (this account; private):
  https://claude.ai/artifact/E8pHqPjx5yGrxqogbi7G1s. The physical map can't load there. The artifact
  version is `web/index.html` minus its `<html>/<head>/<body>` wrapper (keep what's after
  `<!-- page head -->` and the body content, drop the `data:,` favicon), with `web/data/*` as
  supporting files under `data/`.

## Open questions for the owner
- Ohio and the rest of New York: which shetachim, when the owner has them.
- Anything in the current list that turns out wrong (it came from another AI).
- DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands; co-head or deceased head shliach display.
- Data gaps: no listings in Armenia, the Philippines, Albania and a few others.

## Notes for Claude
- This cloud sandbox's network is limited: GitHub (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) and the npm
  registry work; census.gov, geonames.org, cdnjs, jsdelivr, unpkg, openfreemap.org and
  github.io are blocked. That's why counties, towns and tracts come from the Census Bureau's
  GitHub (`uscensusbureau/citysdk`, `v2/GeoJSON/500k/2022/…`) and cities from npm.
  The owner's browser reaches all of them. The real OpenFreeMap tiles can't be seen from here.
- Testing: headless Chromium is at `/opt/pw-browsers`, and the global `playwright` package is
  installed. Chromium doesn't trust the proxy CA, so serve the repo with `page.route`, answer
  cdnjs URLs from local npm copies (`npm install d3@7.9.0 topojson@3.0.2 maplibre-gl@4.7.1` in a
  scratch folder), and fetch anything else with `curl` inside the route handler. For the physical
  map, answer `tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty` with MapLibre's demo style
  (`raw.githubusercontent.com/maplibre/demotiles/gh-pages/style.json`, its tiles and fonts from
  the same branch). WebGL needs `--use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader`.
  Never disable TLS checks.
- Check a desktop (1400×860) and a phone (390×844) viewport, in light and dark, after changes,
  in both Political and Physical.
- Keep the fade's GeoJSON source at `tolerance: 0`: with MapLibre's default simplification, its
  holes break in some tiles and cover parts of the shetachim.
